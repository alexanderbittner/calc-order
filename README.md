# calc-order

Calculates the order of a number in a group. Please provide two integers.
*Note: This tool is a simple university tool developed for personal use. Please take it as such.*

## Usage

run this program with `python3 order.py [number] [number]`, this will try to find the order of the first number in a group specified by the second number.

## Plans and ideas

If you want to add a computation to find whether the first number is a generator of a cyclic group, feel free to reach out. This would make this tool more useful.
